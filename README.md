# Recommender-System
Implementing and comparing various techniques for building a  Recommender System. 


---Recommender System using various approaches.---

Packages required to run the code:
* numpy
* pandas
* math
* time
* scipy
* csv

After downloading the above packages, download this folder and make it the working directory. Then run the corresponding files for the differnet approaches:
* IIcollaborative.py-- for Item-Item Collaborative filtering
* IIcollaborativeWithBaseLine.py --for Item-Item Collaborative filtering with baseline approach
* UUcollaborative.py.py --for User-User Collaborative filtering
* UUcollaborativeWithBaseLine.py.py --for User-User Collaborative filtering with baseline approach
* Latent Factor Mosel.py --for Latent Factor Model

The comparison for all these in mentioned in the design doc.
Dataset was taken from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
